DiMOS (greek δημος = people) is a Distributed Metrics Observation System. It contains facilities to acquire metrics in a reliable way, aggregate them, filter outliers, vote on diverging metrics, and visualise the filtering and voting processes.
DiMOS can be used across different application areas, as collaborative research infrastructure or as prototypical solution in commercial use cases.

Application Areas

<div class="containerarea">

<div class="box">
<b>AI</b><br>
In data-centric artificial intelligence, emphasis is put on the quality of input data due to its impact on autonomous decision-making processes.
DiMOS is a good fit for preprocessing input data in distributed environments.
</div>

<div class="box">
<b>IoT</b><br>
High-quality sensing requires redundant measurement points from which the relevant values need to be determined.
DiMOS offers a suitable foundation for bringing more data science into the Internet of Things.
</div>

<div class="box">
<b>Cloud Computing</b><br>
Cloud software artefacts are known to require heavy testing to avoid inconsistencies, quality deficiencies and bugs.
DiMOS offers methods and tools to automate such testing, assessment and insights generation.

Software Tools

<div class="containerarea">

<div class="box">
<b>DiMOS Orchestrator</b> (formerly MAO Orchestrator)<br>
The orchestrator schedules metrics acquisition and observation through tools executed in sequential workflows (pipelines).
It performs generic actions to increase reliability, including rescheduling in cases of failure, outlier detection, and voting.

<div class="box">
<b>Visualisation</b><br>
A web-based visualisation of multiple independent nodes in a federation of metrics observers including timeline
and statistics on agreements and disagreements.
</div>

<div class="box">
<b>Acquisition and Insights Tools</b><br>
Tools are containerised software responsible for either acquisition or aggregation of metrics, or both.
Their functionality depends on the data sources (e.g. websites, APIs or sensors).

<b>Decentralised Data Quality Control in Ground Truth Production for Autonomic Decisions</b><br>
<i>IEEE TPDS, accepted for publication, 2022</i><br>
Autonomic decision-making based on rules and metrics is inevitably on the rise in distributed software systems.
Often, the metrics are acquired from system observations such as static checks and runtime traces.
To avoid bias propagation and hence reduce wrong decisions in increasingly
autonomous systems due to poor observation data quality, multiple independent observers can exchange their
findings and produce a majority-accepted, complete and outlier-cleaned ground truth in the
form of consensus-supported metrics.
In this work, we motivate the growing importance of metrics for informed and autonomic
decisions in clouds and other distributed systems, present reasons for diverging observations,
and describe a federated approach to produce ground truth with data-centric consensus voting for more reliable decision making processes.
We validate the system design with experiments in the area of cloud software artefact
observations and highlight benefits for reproducible distributed system behaviour.

<b>Towards Reproducible Software Studies with MAO and Renku</b><br>
<i>SoftwareX, accepted for publication, 2022</i>
In software engineering, the developers' joy of decomposing and recomposing microservice-based applications has led
to an enormous wave of microservice artefact technologies. To understand them better, researchers perform hundreds of experiments and empirical studies
on them each year. Improving the reuse and reproducibility of these studies requires two ingredients:
A system to automate repetitive experiments, and a research data management system with emphasis on making research reproducible.
Both frameworks are now available via the Microservice Artefact Observatory (MAO) and Renku.
In this paper, we explain the current capabilities of MAO as a global federated research infrastructure for determining software quality characteristics.
Moreover, we emphasise the integration of MAO with Renku to demonstrate how a reproducible end-to-end experiment workflow involving globally distributed research teams looks like.
